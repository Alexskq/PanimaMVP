# 🛒 **Panima** 


**Panima** is an MVP platform that allows for the management of a self-service store created as a final project in collaboration during the Le Wagon bootcamp in Lille.

A self-service store is a store without cashiers or cash registers. Through this interface, the store manager can remotely and in real-time monitor the best-selling items as well as those that are not performing well. Item restocking occurs automatically based on the remaining stock, and orders are placed automatically every day at midnight. A PDF is generated with the list of ordered items. Manual ordering is also possible if items need to be removed from the stock.
